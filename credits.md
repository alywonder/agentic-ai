# Project Credits

I am a fan of [Pyadantic](https://pydantic.dev/) and when the team behind it
announced an agentic framwork [PydanticAI](https://ai.pydantic.dev/)
I was very excited. Even though i had already built many aspects of ⧊where project
including LLM integration and agentic workflows on top of Pydantic, I have decided
to rebuild the entire project from ground up using PydanticAI as a core component.

I have not only used the PydanticAI framework, but I have also used the PydanticAI
codebase as a reference for many aspects of ⧊where, including the project structure,
continuous integration, and testing.
